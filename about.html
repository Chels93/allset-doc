                    <p class="acknowledgment-text">
                        In the late 1990s, Val Morgan taught me basics of documentation for ICD-9-CM coding. She showed me how physician documentation turns into hospital payment and trained me to write complete diagnoses that met both medical and coding requirements. Val introduced me to coders and encoders, software that takes individual diagnoses and turns them into DRGs for the Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System. She taught me how to craft written and oral queries for physicians, so I stayed in compliance and did not ask leading questions. Val convinced me to rely only on primary sources, rather than the opinions of others regarding coding issues. She grounded me in medicine when it looked like coding was taking over the world. I still marvel that she not only understood illnesses I had never heard of but also knew their ICD-9-CM codes without looking them up. Thank you, Val, for making my career in ICD-10-CM possible. I especially appreciate you for being such a great traveling companion; you always make the world smarter, better, and nicer wherever you are.

                        Clinical indicators (CIs), the symptoms, signs, and test results, that support the selection of one diagnosis over another have gained new prominence since the advent of diagnosis codes. James S. Kennedy, MD, CCS is the guru when it comes to explaining and organizing CIs. I had the good fortune not only of taking Jim's annual course at ACDIS but also of working onsite with him as I developed my slide deck of CIs and integrated them into my presentations. I got to see Jim present CIs to physicians as the building blocks for a diagnosis, just as they learned in medical school, and as the clinical validation demanded by nonclinical coders and auditors to prove the presence of that diagnosis. Thank you, Jim, for illustrating the importance of explicitly documenting the evidence of a diagnosis and for providing up to date, well organized summaries of acceptable CIs for all of us to use.

                        When Lynne Spryszak, RN and I worked on-site together, she modeled successful formal education of coders and CDISs on the fine art of communicating with physicians. Using her vast clinical knowledge, she skillfully walked novice non-clinicians and experienced clinicians alike through the most complicated patient charts to identify documentation opportunities. She would prioritize and organize the issues and carefully craft compliant queries physicians could understand. As her non-physician audience learned to interact productively with physicians, I learned how to turn clinical indicators into persuasive, compliant arguments for more specific diagnoses, an expertise I used extensively as I prepared physicians nationwide for the transition to i10. Using Lynne's logical simplicity, I devised teaching tools to show physicians of all specialties how the specificity of ICD-10-CM could help improve medical care and ensure appropriate payment for hospitals. Thank you, Lynne, for guiding me between medical and coding terminology and providing tools for me to help physicians better understand the difference. You made life easier and more efficient for thousands of physicians. I still thank you daily for being my go-to i10 person and good friend.

                    <p class="acknowledgment-text">
                        There comes a time when random thoughts must be expressed and organized if they are to be productively implemented. When Eileen M. Clifford, MD, realized the very survival of her beneficent St. Joseph's Hospital was jeopardized by poor documentation of excellent medical care, she invited me to work with her medical staff. Her insightful evaluation, of her colleagues' medical and documentation skills, identified those most in need and provided sample charts for me to use in one-on-one sessions with those physicians. Politically astute, she integrated me into the medical staff meeting agenda to present a five-minute documentation improvement lecture and to chronicle the positive impact their documentation changes were having. When i10 implementation was delayed a year, she contracted all my available time to prepare her doctors for i10 documentation requirements. Thank you, Dr. Clifford, for your faith in my teaching abilities and for giving me the opportunity to work with your entire medical staff, for coaching me how best to approach each physician, and for heralding their accomplishments. You were the first ALL SET leader paving the way to i10 success. And, you made me part of the wonderful St. Joe's family, for which I will be eternally grateful.

                        Denise Bino, former Director of Medical Records was the embodiment of the unique, compassionate, and progressive St. Joseph's Healthcare System. In her fifty years there, she worked at least 200,000 hours. When Dr. Clifford first turned me over to this energetic, petite woman, I was immediately impressed by her organizational skills and expertise; and I was overwhelmed by her friendliness and knowledge. Denise was like the ring master in a three-ring circus who doubles as the lion tamer, the trapeze artist, the clown, a juggler balanced on a unicycle, food hawker, costume designer, and mom. Everyone who knows her is sure she must have multiple clones, for no one person could possibly accomplish so much. Denise knew everyone and about everything St. Joes. She is everybody's coach, counselor, mentor, and fan. Thank you, Denise, for taking me under your wing, fostering the development of the system-wide i10 ALL SET DOC-U-Mentation¬Æ documentation education program, encouraging reluctant physicians, keeping me organized, and putting the fun back into dysfunctional. I especially want to thank you for nurturing the ALL SET DOC? mnemonic and making St. Joes my home away from home.

                        My 1973 teaching tools progressed from handwritten acetates and overhead projectors to slides, to successive generations of electronics, which are inherently incompatible with my electromagnetic field. Since 1984, my son Neil Bensen has compassionately supported my computers and other electronic devices. Polite when awakened in the wee hours, resigned when my panic supersedes logic, and tolerant when a simple reboot solves the problem, Neil is an artist at resisting Ctrl-Alt-Del; and, so far, he has refrained from the human equivalent, matricide. After three plus decades, he still patiently explains, for the umpteen thousandth time, why my computer is confused by my expectations, then he "fixes my problem" (often, magically, from over thousands of miles away), so I can carry on my educational tasks. During rescue efforts, Neil has gotten to know tech support at every hospital I've taught at, learned where the today's nearest BestBuy is, and can remind me where, in my computer case, I misplaced each elusive piece of equipment. Thank you, Neil, for rescuing me from myself and making my presentations look effortless to my students. You keep my world turning even when I forget to plug it in.

                        To all my students, thank you for giving me your time, for listening, and for asking questions that prompted me to rewrite, rephrase, and rethink how to best explain the components of efficient 21st century medical documentation. Thank you for your faith in me and for prompting me to develop a more efficient way for us to remember the specifics of ICD-10-CM. Thank you for being the inspiration for the ALL SET DOC?‚Ñ¢ mnemonic and the Physician's Documentation Prescription.

                        The cover of this book was designed by a talented young artist, McKayla Moxcey. My granddaughter, McKayla's creativity is evident in all of her projects. She created a book cover depicting my prescription for the transformation of disconnected signs, symptoms, tests, and treatment responses into a structured ICD-10-CM diagnosis; from chaos through physician to coherent ALL SET DOC?‚Ñ¢ Diagnosis. Thank you, McKayla, for joining my professional team and decorating my book as you have my refrigerator. I love how you and your artwork brighten my life.

                            This book is dedicated to my beloved husband, Kork, who was at my side encouraging me at every step, moderating my often-crazy ideas, and patiently filling in the gaps for the last sixty three years; none of this could have happened without his ever-present love and support. I thank him with all my mind, heart, and soul.
