# ALL SET DOC ? - A Physician's Assistant App

## OVEARVIEW:
A comprehensive mobile application designed specifically for physicians to streamline diagnosis code lookup 
This mobile application provides physicians with a powerful toolkit that combines an intelligent diagnosis code catalog with essential daily management features. Built with insights from medical professionals and direct access to ICD-10 expertise, the app addresses real-world needs in medical practice.

## KEY FEATURES:
- **Intelligent Diagnosis Code Lookup:** Comprehensive ICD-10 diagnosis code catalog with guided question-based interface, offline functionality, and quick search capabilities for accurate code identification in any environment.
- **Professional Credential Management:** Comprehensive tracking system for Continuing Medical Education (CME) credits, certifications, accreditations, and renewal requirements with automated reminders and progress monitoring.
- **Personal & Professional Organization:** Integrated calendar, customizable task management, shopping lists, and seamless cross-device synchronization for comprehensive appointment, deadline, and daily responsibility tracking.

## TECH STACK:
- **Frontend:** 
    - React Native cross-platform mobile development with optimized iOS and Android compatibility and intuitive, mobile-first UI design.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework providing RESTful API architecture and scalable server-side logic.
- **Database & Storage:** PostgreSQL for structured diagnosis code and user data storage with AWS S3 cloud storage for additional resources and documents.
- **Authentication & Security:** Firebase Authentication providing secure user login, profile management, and protected user data with secure session management.
